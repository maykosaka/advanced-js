/*Work with a partner to create a monkey object, which has the following properties:
* name
* species
* foodsEaten
And the following methods:
* eatSomething(thingAsString)
* introduce: produce a string introducing itself, including its name, species, and what it's eaten.
Create 3 monkeys total. Make sure all 3 monkeys have all properties set and methods defined.
Exercise your monkeys by retrieving their properties and using their methods. Practice using both syntaxes
for retrieving properties (dot notation and brackets).
